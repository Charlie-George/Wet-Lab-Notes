**Turning it on**
-----------------

1. Make sure objective lens are at thier lowest point (*turn coarse focus away from you*)
2. Turn the computer on - round button above green and blue lights (see the instructions on the wall for reminder of where the buttons are)
3. Turn on the power strip (red button)
4. Switch on the lk mic (green round button)
5. Pull out the keyboard from under the desk
6. Log on 
7. Open SoftWorx software 
8. File - Aquire Resolve 3D 
9.**MAKE SURE OBJECTIVES ARE AT LOWEST POINT**
10. Click initialize -> software will open up


**Placing your slide on the Microscope** 
----------------------------
If its your first sample or you don't have many cells you might need to do the following to find the right focus 


1. Manually select 20x objective lens 
2. If the stage is not on the microscope - screw this in - you might need to gently lift up the condensor
3. Turn off the light
4. Gently place slide upside down over the objective (so the coverslip is on the bottom) making sure it is level and secure
5. Adjust the stage location so that it is pointing at D or E (this should make sure that your objective is in the right possition for your coverslip)
6. Use the joystick to move the slide so that the coverslip is directly above the objective
7. Place the condensor gently down

**Setting up softworx software**
--------------------------------

1. Neutral density Filter (%T) should ideally not be set to 100 - start at 10% but it will depend on what you are imaging and the strength of your probe - you might need to increase it
2. In Resolve 3D polychroic should be set to quad
3. 'Illumination' should be set to ex (excitation) 
4. Image size (start at 1024x1024) 
Set "Lens" to 100x1.35
Set "Bin" to 1x1
uncheck the "Aux Max" box if you are not using it (this is the push out lever on the right hand side of the microscope that lets you increase the magnification by 1.6x)
5. Make sure the dial under the eye piece is set to 'eyepiece' when you are looking down the lens and  to "camera" when acquiring images 
6. Use the front wheel to set light on DAPI, Cy5, TritC etc (Ex, Em, (Ep = eyepiece) should all show the same)
7. Push the "EX" button of the keyboard to turn it on. 






Imaging your sample 
Remove slide 
Manually select the correct objective (100x ....)
Put a drop (~3mm diameter) of immersion oil with refractive index 1.5514 carefully onto the center of the objective without letting the glass rod touch the lens- rotate the dropper while holding it to prevent the oil falling off.
