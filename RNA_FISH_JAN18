1. Manually select 20x objective lens 
2. If the stage is not on the microscope - screw this in 
3. Gently place slide upside down over the objective (so the coverslip is on the bottom) making sure it is level and secure
4. Adjust the stage location so that it is pointing at D or E (this should make sure that your objective is in the right possition for your coverslip)
