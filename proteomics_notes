Metabolic cycling without cell division cycling in respiring yeast
http://www.pnas.org/content/108/47/19090
These results suggest that the yeast metabolic cycle reflects a growth cycle during G1/G0 and explains our previous puzzling observation that genes annotated to the CDC increase in expression at slow growth

- TMT labelling effected by PH - Ph8-> 8.5 at this ph the N-term should be more acessible then the lysine - if ph is above 8.5 then the labelling is not efficent - more lysines will be available but also the TMT tags will degrae within 1 hr 
- The labelling of the reactions seem to be inefficent as all labelling should occur at the N-term, and then at the K resiude
should have approx 50% 1xTMT - labelled at N-term and approx 50% 2xTMT - labelled at N-term & K
- the pattern is not dependent on abundance 
- the pattern is more pronouced in the phosphodata 
- the pattern is not a result of the instrument or the instrument set up with the machine calling the wrong peaks - the parameters seem to be set up sufficently 
- - More AA in solution = higher PH 
- Is there something biological at these timepoints that mean there is a higher or inaccurate ph reading


**TODO** CHECK pH OF SAMPLES AT THE POINT THEY WERE PROCESSED 



- General workflow 
  - log2 
  - median center
  - if not normally distributed just need to take this into account in your statistical tests
  
  - contaminants filtering - use crapome and filter them out early on 
  - FDR and protein qiuantification 
      - filter based on peptide PEP & q-value 
      - then at the protein level just pick proteins with more then 2 peptides

- looks at protein abundance and stability over the cell cycle - some proteins exhibit changes in stability rather then changes in abundance - notably changes in abundance and stability are not great over the cycle - the main point of change seems to be at the mitotic stage 0 through out the rest of the cycle minimal abundance or protein changes are seen

Identification of differentially expressed proteins, phosphoproteins and glycoproteins
The raw data used in this study were deposited into PRIDE database (dataset identifier PXD003115)12,13. iTRAQ intensities of the 143,020, 140,165, and 143,133 aligned peptides (on average, 142,106 peptides; Supplementary Table S2a–c) were normalized using the quantile normalization method14. Log2-fold-changes of the proteins between gastric cancer and adjacent normal tissues were estimated using the linear-programming method, as previously described15, based on the bipartite graph representing protein groups. Of these quantified proteins, the proteins more than two non-redundant peptides were chosen for the following analyses. First, a statistical hypothesis test for the log2-fold-changes was used to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs)16. An empirical null distribution was estimated by applying Gaussian kernel density estimation method to log2-fold-changes obtained after performing all possible permutations of 114–117 labels17. The proteins with P < 0.05 at least in one of the three tissue pairs were identified as the DEPs. Second, for 19,421, 16,973, and 20,144 phosphopeptides and 4,405, 4,161, and 3,491 N-glycopeptides (on average, 18,846 phosphopeptides and 4,019 N-glycopeptides; Supplementary Table S2a–c), the quantile normalization and the same statistical method was used at the peptide level. The empirical distribution and P-values were estimated for the log2-fold-changes of the peptides. Differentially phosphorylated proteins (DPPs) and differentially N-glycosylated proteins (DGPs) were identified as the proteins that contained the unique phosphopeptides and N-glycopeptides with P < 0.05, or the unique peptides detected exclusively in either the gastric tissue or the normal tissue. Finally, the enrichment analyses of gene ontology biological processes (GOBPs), gene ontology cellular components (GOCCs), and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathways18 were performed for the DEPs, DPPs, and DGPs using ConsensusPathDB19 software. The GOBPs, GOCCs, and KEGG pathways represented by the DEPs, DPPs, and DGPs were identified as the ones with P < 0.1 (a default cutoff). Alternatively, Z score was also computed as Z = N−1 (1 − P), where N−1(∙) is the inverse standard normal distribution and P is the enrichment P-value.

Five types of cellular protein networks
We categorized the cellular protein networks in the KEGG pathway database to the following five groups as shown in Supplementary Table S3: 1) metabolic networks, 2) cellular signaling networks, 3) cell cycle, DNA, and RNA processing networks, 4) protein homeostasis networks, and 5) cellular and organic interaction networks. The proteins in the cellular signaling networks were further grouped into receptor ligands, receptors, kinases/phosphatases, and transcription factors based on the gene ontology molecular functions (‘Receptor binding’, ‘Receptor activity’, ‘Kinase activity’, ‘Phosphatase activity’, and ‘Nucleic acid binding transcription factor activity’, respectively).

698 Proteomics bioinformatics and data analysis
699 Peptide-level output from Proteome Discoverer was re-processed with the
700 add_master_protein.py script (https://github.com/TomSmithCGAT/CamProt) to ensure uniform
701 peptide to protein assignment for all samples from a single experiment and identify peptides
702 which are likely to originate from contaminating proteins such as keratin (see supplementary
703 notes). For quantitative experiments, peptide-level quantification was obtained by summing the
704 quantification values for all peptides with the same sequence but different modifications.
705 Protein-level quantification was then obtained by taking the median peptide abundance. For
706 SILAC experiments, the ratio between treatment and control protein abundance was calculated
707 for each sample separately and aggregated to average protein ratio. For TMT experiments,
708 data analysis was performed using the MSnbase R package56. Log2-transformed protein
709 abundance was centre-median normalised within each sample. For the crude fractionation
710 experiments (n=5), the protein abundance was quantified by label-free quantification, averaged
711 across the replicates per fraction and normalised per protein such that the sum of abundances
712 over the 3 fractions was 1. For the U2OS RBP-Capture experiment, only proteins observed in
713 all 3 CL replicates and no NC replicates were retained. In crosslink-testing SILAC
714 experiments, only proteins present in at least 2 replicates were retained.
715
716 GO terms, Interpro protein domains and KEGG pathway annotations were obtained using the
717 R package UniProt.ws57. GO terms were expanded to include all parent terms using the R
718 package GO.db58. Glycoproteins were identified using the Uniprot59 API with categories=PTM

719 and types=CARBOHYD. Transmembrane proteins were identified using the Uniprot API with
720 types=TRANSMEM.
721
722 Data handling and statistics
723 Data handling was performed with R v3.4.1 using tidyverse packages and python v3.6.5.
724 Plotting was performed with the ggplot2 R package60.
725 Proteins observed only in CL in at least one replicate were deemed enriched. For the RNAse-
726 testing SILAC experiments, proteins only ever observed in the RNAse condition at the organic
727 phase were deemed enriched. Vis versa, those only ever observed in the control condition at
728 the interfaces were deemed depleted. For proteins which did not meet these criteria, all
729 peptides observed across the replicates were treated as independent observations and a
730 Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Test was used to test whether the log2 median CL:NC or
731 RNase:Control ratio was > 0 (enriched) or < 0 (depleted), with a BH-adjusted p-values < 0.05
732 considered significant. Proteins with less than 6 peptides were excluded from the statistical
733 test due to insufficient power.
734 GO, InterPro and KEGG over-representation analyses were conducted using the R package
735 goseq to account for protein abundance. p-values were adjusted to account for multiple testing
736 using the Benjamini-Hochberg61 FDR procedure. GO-terms with adjusted p-value <0.01 and at
737 least 5 proteins were considered significantly over-represented. Over-representation values
738 given are not adjusted for protein abundance. For U2OS and HEK-293, protein abundance
739 was derived from62 taking the maximum abundance recorded across the replicates. For

740 MCF10A, we used an in-house deep proteomics data set. For E.coli, protein abundance was
741 obtained from PaxDB63.
742 For the nocodazole arrest/release experiment, proteins with a change in abundance or RNA
743 binding were identified using the lm function in R. Specifically, to identify protein with a change
744 in abundance between nocodazole arrest and 6 h release, total protein abundance was
745 modelled as a function of the time point alone (abundance ~ timepoint). The p-values for the
746 timepoint coefficients for each proteins were adjusted to account for multiple hypothesis testing
747 according to Benjamini-Hochberg61 and proteins with an adjusted p-value < 0.01 (1 % FDR)
748 were considered to have changed abundance. To identify proteins with a change in RNA
749 binding between nocodazole arrest and 6 h release, protein abundance in the total proteome
750 and OOPS samples was modelled as a function of the time point, the abundance type (total or
751 OOPS), and the interaction between these two variables (abundance ~ timepoint + type +
752 timepoint*type). Here, the interaction term denotes whether the abundance in OOPS and total
753 follows the same pattern across the timepoints (coefficient is zero), indicating total abundance
754 determines the amount of protein bound to RNA, or diverges (non-zero coefficient), indicating
755 a change in RNA binding between the timepoints. The p-values for the interaction term were
756 obtained and adjusted as indicated above. For the heatmap representation, protein
757 abundances were z-score normalised within the total and OOPS samples separately.
758 Hierarchical clustering was performed with the R hclust function using 1-Spearman’s rho as
759 the distance metric and average linkage.

An additional visualization technique for PVDF membranes is transillumination, described by Reig and Klein (1988). In that technique, the membrane is dried at room temperature, then wet with 20% methanol and viewed using white light. Protein bands appear as clear areas. Sensitivity is usually comparable to that of Coomassie blue staining. This approach was recently demonstrated to also be compatible with the new low fluorescence PVDF membranes such as Immobilon-FL (Park, Mauchi, Sharma, 2015). This simple, fast method is a very attractive strategy for imaging blots prior to fluorescent immunodetection.
