Intresting references 

1) Pervasive Protein Thermal Stability Variation during the Cell Cycle https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418303854
- looks at protein abundance and stability over the cell cycle - some proteins exhibit changes in stability rather then changes in abundance - notably changes in abundance and stability are not great over the cycle - the main point of change seems to be at the mitotic stage 0 through out the rest of the cycle minimal abundance or protein changes are seen
